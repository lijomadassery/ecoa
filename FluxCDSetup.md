I'll provide a detailed explanation of how FluxCD was set up in our project.

# Detailed FluxCD Setup and Explanation

## What is FluxCD?

FluxCD is a GitOps operator for Kubernetes that ensures the state of your cluster matches the desired state specified in a Git repository. This provides a continuous deployment pipeline where changes to your Git repository automatically trigger updates to your Kubernetes cluster.

## Components of FluxCD

The FluxCD toolkit consists of several controllers:
- **Source Controller**: Manages external sources (Git repositories, Helm repositories)
- **Kustomize Controller**: Builds and applies Kustomization objects
- **Helm Controller**: Reconciles Helm releases against HelmRepository resources
- **Notification Controller**: Handles events and alerts from other controllers

## Setup Process

### 1. Installing the Flux CLI

We started by installing the Flux command-line interface:

```bash
curl -s https://fluxcd.io/install.sh | sudo bash
```

This installed the `flux` CLI, which is used to bootstrap and interact with FluxCD.

### 2. Checking Prerequisites

We verified that our Kubernetes cluster met the requirements:

```bash
flux check --pre
```

This command checked:
- Connectivity to the Kubernetes cluster
- The Kubernetes version compatibility
- Git client availability

### 3. Creating a GitHub Repository

We created a dedicated GitHub repository called `ecoa-gitops` to store our Kubernetes manifests and FluxCD configuration.

### 4. Generating GitHub Personal Access Token

For FluxCD to interact with GitHub, we created a Personal Access Token with the following permissions:
- `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
- `read:org` (Read organization membership)

### 5. Bootstrapping FluxCD

The key step was bootstrapping FluxCD with our GitHub repository:

```bash
# Set GitHub credentials
export GITHUB_USER=lijomadassery
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<personal-access-token>

# Bootstrap Flux
flux bootstrap github \
  --owner=$GITHUB_USER \
  --repository=ecoa-gitops \
  --branch=main \
  --path=clusters/minikube \
  --personal
```

This command performed several important actions:
- Created a `flux-system` namespace in our Kubernetes cluster
- Installed the FluxCD components (controllers) in that namespace
- Generated SSH deploy keys for the GitHub repository
- Committed the initial configuration to the specified repository path
- Configured FluxCD to sync the repository at the specified path

### 6. Configuring Application Source

Next, we defined a GitRepository resource to tell Flux where our application code resided:

```yaml
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: GitRepository
metadata:
  name: ecoa-app
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 1m
  url: https://github.com/lijomadassery/ecoa.git
  ref:
    branch: main
```

This resource defined:
- The URL of our application repository
- The branch to watch
- How often to check for changes (1 minute)

### 7. Configuring Kustomization

We created a Kustomization resource that defined what to deploy from our source:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: ecoa-app
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 5m
  path: ./kubernetes
  prune: true
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: ecoa-app
  targetNamespace: my-app
```

This Kustomization resource specified:
- The source to use (our GitRepository resource)
- The path within the repository that contains our Kubernetes manifests
- How often to reconcile the resources (5 minutes)
- The namespace to deploy to (my-app)
- Whether to remove resources that are no longer in the repository (prune: true)

### 8. Repository Structure

The repository structure was organized as follows:

```
ecoa-gitops/
└── clusters/
    └── minikube/
        ├── flux-system/  # Created by Flux bootstrap
        │   ├── gotk-components.yaml
        │   ├── gotk-sync.yaml
        │   └── kustomization.yaml
        ├── sources/
        │   └── ecoa-app-source.yaml  # Our GitRepository resource
        └── apps/
            └── ecoa-app.yaml  # Our Kustomization resource
```

Our application repository had this structure:

```
ecoa/
├── frontend/
├── backend/
└── kubernetes/  # Path that Flux syncs
    ├── namespace.yaml
    ├── mysql-deployment.yaml
    ├── backend-deployment.yaml
    └── frontend-deployment.yaml
```

## How FluxCD Works

1. **Continuous Polling**: FluxCD continuously polls the Git repository at the configured interval.
2. **Change Detection**: When changes are detected, FluxCD pulls the updated manifests.
3. **Reconciliation**: The Kustomize Controller applies the changes to bring the cluster to the desired state.
4. **Pruning**: Resources that no longer exist in the manifests are removed if pruning is enabled.

## Benefits of FluxCD in Our Project

1. **GitOps Workflow**: All changes to the cluster go through Git, providing an audit trail and single source of truth.
2. **Continuous Deployment**: Changes to the repository are automatically deployed to the cluster.
3. **Declarative Configuration**: The entire system is defined declaratively in the Git repository.
4. **Self-Healing**: FluxCD continuously reconciles the actual state with the desired state, correcting any drift.

## Validation and Monitoring

After setup, we validated our FluxCD installation with:

```bash
# Check all Flux resources
flux get all

# Check specific resources
flux get sources git
flux get kustomizations

# View Flux logs
flux logs --all-namespaces
```

This setup provided us with a fully automated continuous deployment pipeline based on GitOps principles, where commits to our repository automatically triggered updates to our Kubernetes cluster.
