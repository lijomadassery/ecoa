## Project Overview
The CAMU ECOA (Effective Communication for Armstrong) App is designed to digitize and streamline the process of notifying Hard of Hearing (HOH) incarcerated persons of important announcements and activities within correctional facilities.

2. Create auditable records of communication prompts
3. Ensure compliance with Armstrong lawsuit requirements
4. Improve communication effectiveness with HOH individuals
5. Enable offline functionality with synchronization

### Key Deliverables
1. Digital prompt delivery and signature capture system
2. Offline-capable mobile application
3. Compliance reporting dashboard
4. Integration with existing CDCR systems
5. Comprehensive audit trail

## Target Users
- Primary (80%): Housing Unit Officers / Correctional Officers (COs)
