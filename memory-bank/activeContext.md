   - Enhanced backend health checks
   - Improved frontend routing
   - Secured inter-service communication

3. Development Workflow
   - Streamlined local image builds
   - Enhanced deployment scripts
   - Added health verification
   - Improved troubleshooting tools

### FluxCD & CI/CD
1. Token Authentication
   - Implemented GitHub token auth
   - Configured local image usage
   - Added SSL certificate handling
   - Created test infrastructure

2. Monitoring Setup
   - Added pod health checks
   - Configured service monitoring
   - Implemented access logging
   - Added security verification

3. CI/CD: GitHub Actions pipeline, Docker Hub integration, test scaffolding, secure secrets management

## Active Issues

### SSL Certificate Management
1. Certificate verification failing in pods
2. Need root access for certificate installation
3. Working on secure certificate distribution
4. Testing GitHub API connectivity

### Security Considerations
1. Pod security contexts
2. Root access requirements
3. Certificate management
4. GitHub token handling

### Minikube Docker Certificate Issues
- Minikube's Docker daemon may not trust Docker Hub's SSL certificates by default
- Secure approach: add CA certs to Minikube Docker daemon and restart Docker
- Less secure workaround: use --insecure-registry (not recommended for production)
- Documented and ready for future troubleshooting if needed

## Active Decisions

### Technical Decisions
1. Using MySQL for:
   - JSON column support for metadata
   - Strong indexing capabilities
   - Transaction support with InnoDB
   - Binary logging for audit trail
   - Replication support
   - Connection pooling
   - Query optimization tools

2. Implementing offline-first architecture:
   - IndexedDB for local storage
   - Queue-based synchronization
   - Conflict resolution strategy

3. Security implementation:
   - JWT with refresh tokens
   - Role-based access control
   - Encryption at rest and in transit

4. Using Alpine-based test containers for:
   - Minimal footprint
   - Quick deployment
   - Easy package management
   - SSL testing capabilities

5. SSL Certificate Strategy:
   - Local CA certificates installation
   - Root privilege requirements identified
   - Security context modifications needed
   - Certificate verification procedures

### Active Decisions
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD with test, build, push, and deploy stages
- Use Docker Hub for image registry with secure token-based authentication
- Maintain test scaffolding for both frontend and backend to ensure CI/CD stability
- Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and dashboarding
- Continue to follow GitOps best practices for deployment

## Next Steps

1. Complete SSL certificate configuration for GitHub access
2. Implement automated health checks for all services
3. Enhance monitoring and alerting system
4. Implement backup and restore procedures
5. Add security hardening measures
6. Expand test coverage for frontend and backend
7. Enhance monitoring dashboards and alerting
8. Focus on application features and user experience
