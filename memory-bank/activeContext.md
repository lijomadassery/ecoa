## Active Issues

### SSL Certificate Management
1. Certificate verification failing in pods
2. Need root access for certificate installation
3. Working on secure certificate distribution
4. Testing GitHub API connectivity

### Security Considerations
1. Pod security contexts
2. Root access requirements
3. Certificate management
4. GitHub token handling

## Active Decisions

### Technical Decisions
1. Using MySQL for:
   - JSON column support for metadata
   - Strong indexing capabilities
   - Transaction support with InnoDB
   - Binary logging for audit trail
   - Replication support
   - Connection pooling
   - Query optimization tools

2. Implementing offline-first architecture:
   - IndexedDB for local storage
   - Queue-based synchronization
   - Conflict resolution strategy

3. Security implementation:
   - JWT with refresh tokens
   - Role-based access control
   - Encryption at rest and in transit

4. Using Alpine-based test containers for:
   - Minimal footprint
   - Quick deployment
   - Easy package management
   - SSL testing capabilities

5. SSL Certificate Strategy:
   - Local CA certificates installation
   - Root privilege requirements identified
   - Security context modifications needed
   - Certificate verification procedures

## Next Steps

1. Complete SSL certificate configuration for GitHub access
2. Implement automated health checks for all services
3. Enhance monitoring and alerting system
4. Implement backup and restore procedures
5. Add security hardening measures
