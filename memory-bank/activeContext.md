# CAMU ECOA App Active Context

## Current Focus

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (In Progress)
1. Database schema implementation
   - ‚úÖ Core models defined
   - ‚úÖ Relationships established
   - ‚úÖ Indexes created
   - üîÑ Migration scripts in progress

2. Authentication System
   - ‚úÖ User model created
   - ‚úÖ Password hashing implemented
   - üîÑ JWT implementation in progress
   - ‚è≥ Role-based access control pending

3. Basic API Structure
   - ‚úÖ Project structure set up
   - ‚úÖ Express server configured
   - üîÑ Core endpoints in development
   - ‚è≥ Middleware implementation pending

## Recent Changes

### Database Schema
1. Added MemoryBank model with:
   - Basic fields (title, content, category)
   - Relationships to User, Individual, Facility
   - Metadata and attachment support
   - Offline sync capabilities

2. Enhanced User model with:
   - Role-based access control
   - Facility and unit assignments
   - Audit logging capabilities

3. Implemented Individual model with:
   - Disability tracking
   - Housing unit assignment
   - Memory bank relationships

## Active Decisions

### Technical Decisions
1. Using MySQL for:
   - JSON column support for metadata
   - Strong indexing capabilities
   - Transaction support with InnoDB
   - Binary logging for audit trail
   - Replication support
   - Connection pooling
   - Query optimization tools

2. Implementing offline-first architecture:
   - IndexedDB for local storage
   - Queue-based synchronization
   - Conflict resolution strategy

3. Security implementation:
   - JWT with refresh tokens
   - Role-based access control
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
